# Probabilistic U-Net

This article is the result of a summer internship at the Institute for Information Transmission Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The state-of-the-art Probabilistic U-Net algorithm was tested on the problem of segmentation of brain MRI. During the internship, PyTorch knowledge was deepened, PyCharm and TMUX skills were mastered and the first experience was gained in writing a scientific article in collaboration with professional scientists (the paper http://itas2019.iitp.ru/media/papers/1570582771.pdf). Moreover, the article was presented at the ITaS'19 Conference in Perm (the poster https://github.com/alimbfromlimb/Probabilistic_U-Net/blob/master/POSTER_ITAS.pdf, the conference http://itas2019.iitp.ru).

Unfortunatelly, I can't share code with you, because it is in the private repository of the company (https://github.com/neuro-ml/variational_unet)
